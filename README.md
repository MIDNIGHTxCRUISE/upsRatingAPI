# upsRatingAPI

I struggled to get this UPS Rating API up for a while now. I made this UI for our sales team to use so they can quote prices on products they are selling without having to reach out to the logistics team for them to check on rate pricing.

Please ref this link: https://www.ups.com/upsdeveloperkit
for your API Key and setting up a UPS Account, it's very easy to do so.

UPS has very detailed Documenation and a lot of it so be sure to read up if you are lost or confused.
